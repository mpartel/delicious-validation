# Delicious validation

A simple, no-nonsense Scala validation library.

## Example

Say we're building a webapp and want to validate a request to change one's password. Let's define the request object and its validators.

```scala
import so.delicious.validation._

case class ChangePassword(password: String, passwordAgain:  String) extends Validated {
  password ~ "must be at least 8 characters long" ~ (password.length > 8)

  password ~ "must contain both letters and numbers" ~ {
    password.exists(_.isLetter) && password.exists(_.isDigit)
  }

  passwordAgain ~ "does not match" when (passwordAgain != password)
}
```

Such request objects can be extracted from raw input with e.g. [json4s](https://github.com/json4s/json4s) or [salat](https://github.com/novus/salat).

```scala
val changePassword = json.extract[ChangePassword]
```

Now we can check which fields failed.

```scala
for (e <- changePassword.validationErrors) {
  e.context  // List[Symbol] - e.g. List("passwordAgain")
  e.message  // String       - e.g. "does not match"
  e.value    // Any
}

changePassword.isValid  // Shorthand for `validationErrors.isEmpty`
```

And that's all there is to it. ScalaDocs are available here [TBD], installation instructions and more advanced use cases are below.


## Installation

Scala 2.10.2+ is required.

There are no official releases just yet, but there will be soon.

### SBT

Use `dependsOn` in your _build.scala_:

```scala
object YourBuild extends Build {
  lazy val project = Project("project", file(".")).dependsOn(deliciousValidation)
  lazy val deliciousValidation = RootProject(uri("git://github.com/mpartel/delicious-validation"))
}
```

[TBD: Maven instructions]


## Web frameworks

[TBD: for at least Scalatra and Play!]

### Client-side

[TBD: how to display errors]


## Advanced features

### Two styles: '`~`' vs '`when`'

The following two validations are equivalent, except for the error message:

```scala
x ~ "must not be so small" ~ (x >= 3)
x ~ "is too small" when (x < 3)
```

### Recursive validation and custom field types.

By default, public constructor parameters are automatically validated if they inherit `Validated`, `Some[Validated]`, `Iterable[Validated]` or `Map[_, Validated]`. This is especially useful with custom data types like `EmailAddress`, `PhoneNumber`, `SSN` etc. (Writing such types for your domain is highly recommended!)

```scala
case class EmailAddress(text: String) extends Validated {
  this ~ "must be a valid e-mail address" ~  (text.contains('@'))
}

case class Email(
  from: EmailAddress,
  replyTo: Option[EmailAddress],
  cc: Seq[EmailAddress],
  otherHeaders: Map[String, EmailHeader]
) extends Validated
```

Now if e.g. the third CC address was invalid, the error's context would be `List("cc", "2")`. Note how we use `this` as the context in `EmailAddress`'s validation rule. If we had used `text` instead of `this` then the error context would be `List("cc", "2", "text")`

You can override the protected methods `subobjectsToValidate` and/or `validateSubobjects` to change the default recursive validation behavior.

### Error message localization

Error messages are just plain strings in plain code, so you can pass them through any localization system directly.

```scala
// Imagine "string.tr()" is how you do localization
password ~ "must be at least %d characters".tr(8) ~ (password.length > 8)
```

### External validators

It's possible to put validation rules in a separate `Validator` object.

```scala
case class CreateUser(email: EmailAddress, password: String) extends ExternallyValidated

object ChangePassword {
  implicit val validator = defineValidator[CreateUser] {
    // Note: we must refer to fields via `obj`.
    obj.password ~ "must be at least 8 characters" ~ (password.length > 8)
  }
}

// Obtain an implicit validator.
// Works the same as implicitly[Validator[CreateUser]].
val validator = validatorFor[CreateUser]
val result = validator.validate(ChangePassword("abc123"))
result.validationErrors
result.isValid
```

Whether you want to use `Validated` or `ExternallyValidated` is a matter of preference and depends on your project setup. The two can be mixed such that an ExternallyValidated can contain Validated objects, but not vice versa (since cannot resolve implicits at runtime).


[TODO: consider `... extends Validated { def validator(di, params) = <macro call> }`. Combines the advantages of both, except maybe for DI. Consider Guice and Cake.]

#### Advangates of `ExternallyValidated`.

- Works better with some dependency-injectors unless you're prepared to make the injector global or thread-local.
- Subvalidatables are resolved at compile-time instead of reflectively at runtime.

#### Advantages of plain `Validated`

- More concise.
- Validation rules closer to the object.

### Dependency injection

[TBD]

### Reusable validation rules

[TBD]

### Maximum size annotations

[TBD]


## Caveats

- Subclasses of Validatable should be public and top-level. Otherwise the compiler may optimize away too much and the reflection that autovalidates subfields can fail.


## Rationale

- Validation conditions should be written in plain code, not some [complicated DSL](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Validation.html) or [clunky annotation system](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/validation.html).
- Error messages should be close to the validation code. Although we also support reusable validators, we believe a little potential repetition in the name of simplicity is a good tradeoff here.
- Validation errors should know the field that failed so the UI can display the error in the appropriate place.
- Validated objects should be composable. We validate fields recursively.
- Error message sentence structure should be not be limited.


## How it works

For those interested, there is a little bit of macro magic involved in capturing the names of the fields.

A "*field expression*" is either `this` or any expression that accesses a field or subfield. E.g. `[this.]address.zipCode` is a field expression but `a + b` is not.

An [implicit macro](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/implicits.html) converts any field expression to an object that carries the names of the fields in the field expression. The object has the '~(msg: String)' method, from which our little DSL continues like you'd expect. One awesome feature of implicit macros is that they let us give a clear error message when the expression before the tilde is not a field expression.
